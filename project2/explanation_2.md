Efficiency: There is a clear and accurate statement of efficiency in time and space. There is an explanation that specifically mentions parts of the code that contribute to the overall efficiency.

Time eff: O(n)
We have to explore all the 'nodes' in fs tree

Space eff: O(n)
stack and results python lists in worst case (all fs 'nodes' are match for given suffix) would hold O(n) fs tree 'nodes'.


Code Design: Explanation contains some discussion of design choices made in the code. Some examples include the choice of algorithm and data structure.
I decided to explore given fs tree with use of Stack (in this case python list with append and pop methods).

Readability: Explanation is written with proper English. Wording is clear and easy to understand. Itâ€™s okay to make a couple mistakes, but thoughts should be clearly expressed overall.
