Efficiency
There is a clear and accurate statement of efficiency. There is an explanation that specifically mentions parts of the code that contribute to the overall efficiency.

- Time efficiency: 0(n) - single pass is sufficient to find min and max vals
  Space efficiency(not counting input): 0(1) - storing values for min, max and iterator

Code Design
Explanation contains some discussion of design choices made in the code. Some examples include the choice of algorithm and data structure.

- To find min and max, I keep two values min and max, iterate through all elements in the input list and keep comparing and asigning if element is smaller than previously seen min or larger than previolsy seen max
