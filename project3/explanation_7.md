Efficiency
There is a clear and accurate statement of efficiency. There is an explanation that specifically mentions parts of the code that contribute to the overall efficiency.

- Time efficiency: O(n) where n is number of nodes after path is parsed 
                        - time dominating code is present in insert and find methods of RouteTrie class
                          more specifically this is a traversal code common for both methods:

                              for n in path_list:
                                  if n not in node.children:
                                      ...
                                  node = node.children[n]

                          which is resulting with O(n) time efficiency

  Space efficiency: O(n) where n is number of nodes after path is parsed
                         - worst case is that we could have all unique paths with non overlapping nodes
                         - space efficiency for find method is O(1)

Code Design
Explanation contains some discussion of design choices made in the code. Some examples include the choice of algorithm and data structure.

- As suggested by problem itself I've started with previous Trie example/problem as base. The rest was implementing Router class which is handling path input, and using add_handler and and lookup as wrapper for RouteTrie's insert and find methods.
